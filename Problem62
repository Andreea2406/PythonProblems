#A word is a palindrome if it reads the same in both directions. For example, "racecar" is a palindrome. A sentence is palindromic if, by eliminating spaces and other punctuation marks, it becomes a palindrome. For example, "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama" is palindromic. Write a program that reads several sentences and determines about each if it is palindromic.

    for prop in props:
        nprop = prop.replace(" ", "") \
            .replace(".", "") \
            .replace(",", "") \
            .replace("!", "") \
            .replace("?", "") \
            .replace("-", "")
        print(int(nprop == nprop[::-1]))

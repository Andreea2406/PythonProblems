#Two friends are on the Ox axis, at integer coordinates. The first is at point x1 = a, and the second is at point x2 = b. Each can move one position left or right an unlimited number of times. When moving, fatigue changes according to the following rule: the first move increases fatigue by 1, the second move by 2, the third by 3, and so on. The friends want to meet at a point with an integer coordinate. Determine the minimum total fatigue the two will accumulate. Create a function that receives parameters a and b.

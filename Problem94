There are three types of coins: the first type of coin is worth a Martian lei, the second type is worth b Martian lei, and the third type of coin is worth c Martian lei. Martian Iggle has n coins of the first type, m coins of the second type, and p coins of the third type. How many Martian lei does Iggle have?
